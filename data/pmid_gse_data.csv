30530648,200116672,In vivo molecular signatures of severe dengue infection revealed by viscRNA-Seq,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Dengue virus infection can result in severe symptoms including shock and hemorrhage, but an understanding of the molecular correlates of disease severity is lacking. Bulk transcriptomics on blood samples are difficult to interpret because the blood is composed of different cell types that may react differently to virus infection. Dengue virus RNA can be detected in human plasma, however identifying the cells carrying dengue virus through the bloodstream in vivo has proven challenging. Here we used our recently developed viscRNA-Seq approach to profile transcriptomes of thousands of single blood peripheral mononuclear cells from 6 human subjects with dengue fever and severe dengue, as well as to characterize the cell types associated with dengue virus in the human blood. We found that although no bulk transcriptome marker for severe dengue exists, the expression of MX2 in naive B cells, of CD163 in CD14+/CD16+ monocytes and of other genes in specific cell types is highly predictive for severe dengue. We detected virus-associated cells in the blood of two severe dengue patients with high viral load and discovered the majority of these to be B cells expressing germline IgM or IgD immunoglobulin chains and naive markers but also showing signs of activation and expression of CD69, CXCR4, and other surface receptors. In bystander B cells we detected signs of strong immune activation, parallel hypersomatic evolution and, in one severe degue subject, an anomalously large clone of highly mutated, IgG1 plasmablasts that could be reactive to dengue virus. This study presents a high-resolution molecular exploration into dengue virus infection in humans and can be generalized to any RNA virus.",Homo sapiens,N/A

Here we analyzed the gene expression profiles of more than 10,000 individual microglia cells isolated from cortex and hippocampus of male and female AppNL-G-F at 4 different stages of Aβ deposition and in age-matched control mice. We demonstrate that microglia adopt two major activated states during normal aging and after exposure to amyloid plaques.

To circumvent these issues, here we generated 138,577 single cell expression profiles of human stem cell-derived microglia xenotransplanted in the brain of the AppNL-G-F model of amyloid pathology and wild type controls. Xenografted human microglia adopt a disease-associated (DAM) profile similar to that seen in mouse microglia, but display a more pronounced HLA state, likely related to antigen presentation in response to amyloid plaques. The human microglial response also involves a pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine CRM response to oligomeric Aβo. Genetic deletion of TREM2 or APOE, as well as APOE polymorphisms and TREM2R47H expression in the transplanted microglia modulate these responses differentially. The expression of other AD risk genes is differentially regulated across the distinct cell states elicited in response to amyloid pathology. Thus, we have identified multiple transcriptomic cell states adopted by human microglia in response to AD-related pathology, which should be taken into account in translational studies.",Homo sapiens,N/A

However, it is currently unclear what genomic features control variation in gene expression levels, and whether common genetic variants may impact gene expression variation. Here, we take a genome-wide approach to identify expression variance quantitative trait loci (vQTLs). To this end, we generated single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from 53 Yoruba individuals. We collected data for a median of 95 cells per individual and a total of 5,447 single cells, and identified 241 mean expression QTLs (eQTLs) at 10% FDR, of which 82% replicate in bulk RNA-seq data from the same individuals. We further identified 14 vQTLs at 10% FDR, but demonstrate that these can also be explained as effects on mean expression. Our study suggests that dispersion QTLs (dQTLs), which could alter the variance of expression independently of the mean, have systematically smaller effect sizes than eQTLs. We estimate that at least 300 cells per individual and 400 individuals would be required to have modest power to detect the strongest dQTLs in iPSCs. These results will guide the design of future studies on understanding the genetic control of gene expression variance.",Homo sapiens,N/A

In this study, we used single-cell RNA-seq to identify 11 transcriptionally diverse CD8+ T cell subsets in psoriatic and healthy skin. Among several inflammatory subsets enriched in psoriatic skin, we observed two Tc17 subsets that were metabolically divergent, developmentally related, and expressed CXCL13, which we found to be a biomarker of psoriasis severity. Despite high co-inhibitory receptor expression in the Tc17 clusters, a comparison of these cells with melanoma-infiltrating CD8+ T cells revealed upregulated cytokine, cytolytic, and metabolic transcriptional activity in the psoriatic cells that differed from an exhaustion program. Our findings provide a high-resolution view of cutaneous CD8+ T cells in psoriasis and healthy skin and shed light on their functional distinctions within the chronic pathologies of autoimmunity and cancer.",Homo sapiens,N/A
21057496,200023694,Analysis and design of RNA sequencing experiments for identifying mRNA isoform regulation,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,"Through alternative splicing, most human genes express multiple isoforms that may have distinct or even antagonistic functions. To infer isoform regulation based on data from high-throughput sequencing of cDNA fragments (RNA-Seq), we have developed MISO, a computational model that estimates the expression level of alternatively spliced exons and mRNA isoforms and provides intuitive measures of conﬁdence in these estimates. Incorporation of the length distribution of inserted cDNA fragments in paired-end RNA-Seq analysis in MISO enables dramatic improvements in estimation of alternative splicing levels relative to previous methods. We show that one lane of paired-end RNA-Seq data can provide far more information about splicing than two lanes of single-end data, depending critically on properties of the distribution of cDNA fragment lengths in the sequenced library. MISO also leads to an intuitive method to detect diﬀerentially regulated exons or isoforms. Application of this method implicates the RNA splicing factor hnRNP H in regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, a role that is supported by UV crosslinking/immunoprecipitation/high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq) analysis. Together, our results provide a probabilistic framework for RNA-Seq analysis, derive functional insights into pre-mRNA processing, and yield guidelines for the optimal design of RNA-Seq experiments for studies of gene and isoform expression.",Mus musculus; Homo sapiens,N/A

Here, we employ single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to characterize developing Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, with a focus on endosperm. Endosperm, the site of gene imprinting in plants, mediates the relationship between the maternal parent and embryo. We identify new cell types in the chalazal endosperm region, which interfaces with maternal tissue for nutrient unloading. We further demonstrate that the extent of parental bias of maternally expressed imprinted genes varies with cell cycle phase, and that imprinting of paternally expressed imprinted genes is strongest in chalazal endosperm. These data indicate imprinting in endosperm is heterogeneous and suggest that parental conflict, which is proposed to drive the evolution of imprinting, is fiercest at the boundary between filial and maternal tissues.",Arabidopsis thaliana,N/A

Enigmatically, plants induce similar transcriptome responses upon infection by virulent or avirulent pathogens. This renders the importance of transcriptional reprogramming for immunity obscure. Here, using RNA-seq, we generate time-series transcriptome data coupled with genetic perturbations to reveal temporal dynamics upon infection by virulent or avirulent strains of a bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae, in Arabidopsis thaliana. Fast and sustained transcriptional reprogramming occurs upon infection with avirulent strains while virulent strain infection leads to a slower response with comparable gene expression patterns and magnitudes. Importantly, transcriptome analysis of resistant and susceptible mutants responding to avirulent strains links delayed transcriptional reprogramming to compromised immunity.

It has long been postulated that epigenetics plays a key role in these processes, but with one or two exceptions, solid evidence for the role of epigenetic variation in these processes is lacking. A key impediment to understanding these processes is the lack of information on the extent of epigenetic variation and how it relates to genetic and phenotypic variation in natural population, both over the lifecycle of an individual, and over evolutionary time. Here we show that genetic variants under selection in the north of Sweden appear to drive variation in DNA methylation, which in turn is highly correlated with local climate. Selective sweeps and genetic variants associated with adaptation to the local environment have previously been identified within the Swedish Arabidopsis population. Our finding that they harbour variants responsible for climate associated epigenetic variation strongly supports the role of epigenetic processes in local adaptation.

These proteins also silenced many other genes with different efficacy, and a machine learning model could accurately predict the efficacy of each silencer based on various chromatin features of the target loci.

Although computational approaches have been developed to integrate single-cell datasets, their efficacy still needs to be determined with reference to authentic single-cell multi-omic profiles. To address this challenge, we devised single-nucleus methylCytosine, Chromatin accessibility and Transcriptome sequencing (snmC2T-seq) and applied the approach to post-mortem human frontal cortex tissue. We developed a computational framework to evaluate the quality of finely defined cell types using multi-modal information and validated the efficacy of computational multi-omic integration methods. Correlation analysis in individual cells revealed gene groups showing distinct relations between methylation and expression. Integration of snmC2T-seq with other multi- and single- modal datasets enabled joint analyses of the methylome, chromatin accessibility, transcriptome, and chromatin architecture for 63 human cortical cell types. We reconstructed the regulatory lineage of these cortical cell types and found pronounced cell-type-specific enrichment of disease risks for neuropsychiatric traits, predicting causal cell types that can be targeted for treatment.",Homo sapiens,N/A

However, a comprehensive assessment of the epigenetically distinct neuronal classes is currently missing. Cytosine DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that distinguishes neuron types and marks gene regulatory elements. We developed an efficient single-nucleus methylome sequencing approach that allows robust high-throughput neuron-type classification. We generated >6,000 single-nucleus methylomes and identified 16 mouse and 21 human neuronal subpopulations in the frontal cortex. Both CG and non-CG methylation exhibited cell type-specific distributions that recapitulate and extend findings from single neuron transcriptome profiling. Moreover, we found approximately 500,000 neuron-type-specific regulatory elements showing strong differential methylation in mouse and human cortex. Distinct methylation signatures identified an unique human Parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory sub-type and a layer 6 specific excitatory sub-type in mouse. Comparative epigenomic analysis showed stronger conservation of gene regulatory elements in inhibitory compared with excitatory neurons. These findings demonstrate the utility of single nucleus methylome profiling for both expanding the atlas of brain cell types and identifying regulatory elements that potentially drive these differences.",Mus musculus; Homo sapiens,N/A

Single-cell variations of methods such as DNA methylation-sequencing and ATAC-seq hold tremendous promise for delineating distinct cell types and identifying their critical cis-regulatory sequences. Emerging evidence in recent years has shown that in addition to cis-regulatory sequences, dynamic regulation of 3D chromatin conformation is a critical mechanism for the modulation of gene expressions during development and disease. While assays for the investigation of single-cell 3D chromatin structure have been developed, cell-type specific chromatin conformation in primary human tissues has not been extensively explored.

While DNA methylation dynamics have already been implicated during neurodevelopment, little is known about hydroxymethylation in this process. Here we report DNA hydroxymethylation dynamics during cerebellum development in the human brain. Overall, we find a positive correlation between 5-hmC levels and cerebellum development. Genome-wide profiling reveals that 5-hmC is highly enriched on specific gene regions, including exons and especially the untranslated regions (UTRs), but it is depleted on introns and intergenic regions. Furthermore, we have identified fetus-specific and adult-specific differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs), most of which overlap with genes and CpG island shores. Surprisingly, during development DhMRs are highly enriched in genes encoding mRNAs that can be regulated by fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), some of which are disrupted in autism, as well as in many known autism genes. Our results suggest that 5-hmC-mediated epigenetic regulation may broadly impact the development of the human brain, and its dysregulation could contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.",Homo sapiens,N/A

The CTD in mammals is composed of 52 heptad-repeats with the consensus sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7. Repeats in the distal part of CTD deviate from the consensus sequence and have frequently replaced serine at position 7 by lysine residues (K7). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed modification of K7 residues in heptad-repeats 39, 42, and 47/49 by acetylation and in heptad-repeats 38, 39, 40, 42, and 47/49 by mono-, di-, or trimethylation. Notably, acetylated as well as di- and tri-methylated K7 residues were found exclusively in phosphorylated CTD peptides, while mono-methylated K7 residues occurred also in non-phosphorylated CTD peptides. Methylation of K7 residues was further studied with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1F5, which recognizes mono- and di-methylated K7 in CTD. ChIP experiments revealed high levels of K7 methylation at the transcriptional start site of genes. The low levels of K7 methylation in the body of genes results from impairment of epitope recognition in hyper-phosphorylated CTD by mAb 1F5. In agreement with this notion, phosphatase treatment of hyper-phosphorylated CTD or treatment of cells with kinase inhibitor flavopiridol restored the reactivity of mAb 1F5 towards methylated K7 residues in CTD. We conclude that methylation and acetylation of K7 residues further expand the mammalian CTD code and potentially contribute to regulation of gene expression.",Homo sapiens,N/A

Most of the studies characterizing DNA methylation patterns have been restricted to particular genomic loci in a limited number of human samples and pathological conditions. The recently arrived single-base-resolution technologies for DNA methylation are extremely helpful tools, but are not yet applicable and affordable for studying large groups of subjects. Herein, we present a compromise between an extremely comprehensive study of a human sample population with an intermediate level of resolution of CpGs at the genomic level. We obtained a DNA methylation fingerprint of 1,628 human samples where we interrogated 1,505 CpG sites. The DNA methylation patterns revealed show this epigenetic mark to be critical in tissue-type definition and stemness, particularly around transcription start sites that are not within a CpG island. For disease, the generated DNA methylation fingerprints show that, during tumorigenesis, human cancer cells underwent a progressive gain of promoter CpG island hypermethylation and a loss of CpG methylation in non-CpG island promoters. Although transformed cells are those where DNA methylation disruption is more obvious, we observed that other common human diseases, such as neurological and autoimmune disorders, had their own distinct DNA methylation profiles. Most importantly, we provide proof of principle that the obtained DNA methylation fingerprints might be useful for translational purposes by showing that are able to identify the tumor type origin of Cancers of Unknown Primary (CUPs).

However, the pathogenic variants in these loci have not yet been found. We conducted a genome-wide scan for large copy number variations (CNVs) in a dataset of Caribbean Hispanic origin (554 controls and 559 cases with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease) that was previously investigated in a SNP-based genome-wide association study using Illumina HumanHap 650Y platform. We ran four CNV calling algorithms and analyzed rare large CNVs (>100 Kb) to obtain high-confidence calls that were detected by at least two algorithms. In total, 734 such CNVs were observed in our dataset. Global burden analyses did not reveal significant differences between cases and controls in CNV rate, distribution of deletions or duplications, total or average CNV size; and number of genes affected by CNVs. However, we observed a nominal association between Alzheimer’s disease and a ~470 Kb duplication on chromosome15q11.2 (P=0.037). This duplication, encompassing up to five genes (TUBGCP5, CYFIP1, NIPA2, NIPA1 and WHAMML1) was present in 10 cases (2.6%) and 3 controls (0.8%). The dosage increase of CYFIP1 and NIPA1 genes was further confirmed by quantitative PCR. The current study did not detect CNVs (including common CNVs) that affect novel Alzheimer’s disease loci reported by large genome-wide association studies. However, since the array technology used in our study has limitations in detecting small CNVs, future studies must carefully assess novel AD associated genes for the presence of disease related CNVs.",Homo sapiens,N/A

Using distinct AD mouse models, cultured human primary and established neural stem cells, and human patient material, we demonstrate that AHN is directly impacted by AD pathology. miR-132 replacement in adult mouse AD hippocampus restores AHN and relevant memory deficits.

Single-cell RNA-sequencing uncovered three epicardial subpopulations with specific genetic programmes and distinctive spatial distribution within the developing heart. Perturbation of unique gene signatures uncovered distinct functions associated with each subpopulation and established novel epicardial roles in cell adhesion, migration, and chemotaxis as a mechanism for recruitment of leukocytes into the heart. This work elucidates the mutual spatiotemporal relationships between different epicardial subpopulations and assigns unique function to each during cardiac development.

Science. 2018) to design SPATAC-seq, which in situ label chromatin fragment in the same single cell through combinatorial barcoding. Briefly, in SPATAC-seq, (1) fixed nuclei are transposed in 48 different wells by 48 unique Tn5 transposase, which containing barcoded adaptors and 5'-phosphorylation; (2) the nuclei from all wells are collected and redistributed into second and third 48-well plate in turn, where the next two rounds of indexing are achieved through into either end of the custom transposome, which result in the generation of more than 110,000 (48^3) unique barcode combinations. (3) the nuclei are pooled, split into sublibraries and lysed, and the DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which introduce illumina sequencing barcodes and complete libraries construction. (4) After sequencing, fastq files were demultiplexed according to the same four-barcode combinations. For profiling more cells in one sublibrary, we can increase the number of barcode combinations by increase the number of indexing of each round to 96, which can produce about 1 million combinations. To assess the fidelity of SPATAC-seq, we performed a species-mixing experiment with cultured human (K562) and mouse (Hepa) cells. Here, we tagged mixed permeabilized nuclei with only 8 barcoded transposome.

How non-coding molecular factors such as microRNAs influence these developmental trajectories and regulate the acquisition of cortical type identities is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that miR-137 and miR-122 regulate the positioning and identity features of superficial layer cortical neurons by acting at distinct steps of their developmental trajectories. MiR-137 sustains basal progenitor amplification by reverting their neurogenic commitment and inducing high proliferative state upregulating Cd63 and inhibiting Myt1l. Cd63 is an extra-cellular matrix (ECM) receptor which interacts with b3- and 1-integrin pathways to promote proliferation, while Myt1l is a transcription factor that promotes and sustains neuronal fate. The BPs amplification by miR-137 is converted in the promotion of intracortical projecting neuron (ICPN) identity and L2/3 expansion. As opposed to miR-137, miR-122 acts postmitotically, affecting the bioelectrical properties, the calcium and cytoskeleton dynamics of newborn neurons as well as their transcriptional program, leading to a persistent molecular immaturity across time. Overall, these findings reveal that miR-137 and miR-122 are key regulators of the developmental trajectory of cortical neurons across evolution.",Mus musculus,N/A

Here we identify a brief period in ferret embryonic development when apical RGCs generate a burst of bRGCs that become founders of the OSVZ. After this period, bRGCs in the OSVZ proliferate and self-renew exclusively locally, thereby forming a self-sustained lineage independent from the other germinal layers. The time window for the brief period of OSVZ bRGC production is delineated by the coincident down-regulation of Cdh1 and Trnp1, and their up-regulation reduces bRGC production and prevents OSVZ seeding.

We find unique transcriptional signatures in each germinal compartment, indicating that thousands of genes are differentially expressed between regions, including ~80% of genes mutated in human cortical malformations. Regional differences result from sharp changes in gene expression levels, which occur at multiple locations across the developing cortex of ferret and human, but not in the lissencephalic mouse. These complex expression patterns emerge sequentially during development and map the eventual location of specific folds and fissures.

Data suggest the importance of miRNAs to cancer development and possibly to survival. Our overall hypothesis is that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses. While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and to survival.

MiRNA was obtained from dissected paraffin-embedded tissue and assessed using an Agilent microarray platform. We intend to extend our validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype (TP53, KRAS2, CIMP+, and for colon tumors MSI+), inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival. We will identify associations with miRNAs that are related to specific molecular phenotypes, with drivers in the carcinogenic process, and with clinical features and survival. These miRNAs will be validated using targeted Agilent Platform. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models. Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals. MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment as well as provide support that miRNAs function as the “driver” in the carcinogenic process. Testing of mutated miRNAs identified from sequencing in conjunction with tumor phenotype, clinical, and survival data will further validate the importance of these miRNAs, and provide insight as to which CRC molecular pathway the miRNAs function. Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 1975 CRC and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNA expression and mutation in a large sample of population-based cases in the most cost-efficient manner possible. The miRNAs identified in these analyses will elucidate pathways important in the etiology of CRC and will provide insight into potential targets for screening and treatment. MiRNAs are small, non-protein-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression either by post-transcriptionally suppressing mRNA translation or by mRNA degradation. We examine differentially expressed miRNAs in colorectal carcinomas, adenomas, and normal colonic mucosa. Data come from population-based studies of colorectal cancer conducted in Utah and the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. A total of 1893 carcinoma/normal paired samples and 290 adenoma tissue samples were run on the Agilent Human miRNA Microarray V19.0 which contained 2006 miRNAs. We tested for significant differences in miRNA expression between paired carcinoma/adenoma/normal colonic tissue samples. Fewer than 600 miRNAs were expressed in >80% of people for colonic tissue; of these 86.5% were statistically differentially expressed between carcinoma and normal colonic mucosa using a False Discovery Rate of 0.05. Roughly half of these differentially expressed miRNAs showed a progression in levels of expression from normal to adenoma to carcinoma tissue. Other miRNAs appeared to be altered at the normal to adenoma stage, while others were only altered at the adenoma to carcinoma stage or only at the normal to carcinoma stage. Evaluation of the Agilent platform showed a high degree of repeatability (r=0.98) and reasonable agreement with the NanoString platform. Our data suggest that miRNAs are highly dysregulated in colorectal tissue among individuals with colorectal cancer; the pattern of disruption varies by miRNA as tissue progresses from normal to adenoma to carcinoma.",Homo sapiens,N/A

To complement research on miRNA-mimicking oligonucleotides targeting the central nervous system, we developed a high-throughput-screen coupled high-throughput-sequencing (HTS-HTS) in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons to identify small molecule inducers of miR-132. We discovered that cardiac glycosides, which are canonical sodium-potassium ATPase inhibitors, selectively upregulated miR-132 in the sub-μM range. Coordinately, cardiac glycoside treatment downregulated total and phosphorylated Tau in rodent and human neurons and protected against toxicity by glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, rotenone, and Aβ oligomers. In conclusion, we identified small-molecule drugs that upregulated the neuroprotective miR-132 and ameliorated neurodegenerative phenotypes.

39838364,200268524,A robust circulating microRNA signature for diagnosis and early detection in pancreatobiliary cancer,Non-coding RNA profiling by array,"Purpose: Oncologists for pancreatobiliary cancer (PBca) demand a new circulating biomarker superior to carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). This study aimed to identify the serum microRNA signature composed of reproducible and disease-related microRNAs with clinical bioinformatics. Methods: This multicenter study enrolled patients with treatment-naïve PBca and healthy participants. Optimized serum processing condition was evaluated with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization. The serum microRNA candidates were selected in disease association with Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA). A microRNA signature, combination of multiple serum microRNAs, was examined in exploratory, validation and independent validation set. Biology of the diagnostic miRNAs was evaluated using human pancreatic cancer cells. Results: The 284 (healthy 150, PBca 134) of 827 serum samples were processed within 2hr of time-to serum collection, distributed at the same area of t-SNE map, assigned to exploratory set. The 193 optimized samples were assigned to validation (healthy 50, PBca 47) or independent validation set (healthy 50, PBca 46). Index-1 was a combination of the 5 serum microRNAs having disease-association on WGCNA, showed a sensitivity/specificity >80% and an AUC outperforming CA19-9 in exploratory, validation and independent validation set. The AUC of Index-1 for detecting T1 tumor was superior to CA19-9 (0.856 vs. 0.649, p = 0.038). Human pancreatic cancer cells had intra- and extracellular expression of miR-665, a component of Index-1. Transfection of miR-665 to a human pancreatic cancer cell inhibited cell growth. Conclusions: A serum microRNA signature, Index-1, was useful for detecting PBca, which would improve the early diagnosis of PBca.",Homo sapiens,N/A

36650381,200168613,Inflammation of the Aged Bone Marrow Niche Drives Blood Aging,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Hematopoietic aging is defined by a loss of regenerative capacity and skewed differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) leading to dysfunctional blood production. Signals from the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment dynamically tailor hematopoiesis, but the effect of aging on the niche and the contribution of the aging niche to blood aging still remains unclear. Here, we show the development of an inflammatory milieu in the aged marrow cavity, which drives both niche and hematopoietic system remodeling. We find decreased numbers and functionality of osteogenic endosteal mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), expansion of pro-inflammatory perisinusoidal MSCs, and deterioration of the central marrow sinusoidal endothelium, which together create a self-reinforcing inflamed BM milieu. Single cell molecular mapping of old niche cells further confirms disruption of cell identities and enrichment of inflammatory response genes. Inflammation, in turn, drives chronic activation of emergency myelopoiesis pathways in old HSCs and multipotent progenitors, which promotes myeloid differentiation at the expense of lymphoid and erythroid commitment, and hinders hematopoietic regeneration. Remarkably, both defective hematopoietic regeneration, niche deterioration and HSC aging can be improved by blocking inflammatory IL-1 signaling.

Under CR, mice self-impose chronic cycles of 2-hour-feeding and 22-hour-fasting, raising the question whether calories, fasting, or time of day are causal. We show that 30%-CR is sufficient to extend lifespan 10%; however, a daily fasting interval and circadian-alignment of feeding act together to extend lifespan 35% in male C57BL/6J mice. These circadian effects of CR are independent of fasting duration and body weight. Aging induces widespread increases in gene expression associated with inflammation and decreases in expression of genes encoding components of metabolic pathways in liver from ad lib fed mice. CR at night ameliorates these aging-related changes. Thus, circadian interventions promote longevity and provide a perspective to further explore mechanisms of aging.",Mus musculus,N/A

38287646,200130633,Effects of losmapimod on antigen-specific response in aged skin,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Older humans are more susceptible to infections, even those to which they were immune to in their youth. Vaccination against many different infectious agents is also sub-optimal in these individuals. To investigate the mechanisms involved in the decline in immunity during ageing we inject safe derivatives of microorganisms into the skin of old and young volunteers. After injection of the agent, we can extract the white cells (leucocytes) that accumulate at the site of the immune response to test for their function. One of the responses we have been investigating is that to the varicella zoster virus (VZV) that induces chickenpox mainly in young individuals. Infected subjects control this persistent virus until an older age where reduced immunity leads to viral re-activation to cause shingles. We have found that this defective response is associated with increased baseline inflammation in this tissue. Although inflammatory responses are required to clear infections, excessive inflammation has previously been shown to interfere with the generation of specific immunity. We will therefore investigate ways of enhancing the immune response of older humans by blocking basal inflammation. To extend our initial observations of high background inflammation in the skin, we will investigate which cells in this tissue are responsible for the production of inflammatory mediators by using a second human experimental system that tests the response to a skin irritant known as cantharadin. Next we will block inflammation in the skin to determine whether this can lead to improved responses upon challenge with antigens. This will be achieved by pre-treating old subjects with a drug that has already been developed by GSK (Losmapimod, p38MAPkinase inhibitor) and another that is available off the shelf (vitamin D3). The GSK p38 inhibitors are currently being tested to prevent unwanted inflammation. A surprising observation we made was that p38 inhibition could also rejuvenate human T lymphocytes and enhance their ability to proliferate in vitro. Therefore the inhibition of p38 may block unwanted inflammatory response as well as enhance T lymphocyte reactivity. Vitamin D3 has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and works in part by inhibiting p38MAPkinase activation. The use of 2 separate interventions in this project increases the likelihood of success in this study. While Losmapimod may be more specific in its anti-inflammatory action, the use of vitamin D3 is more cost effective as it is a cheap compound that is readily available. The desirable outcome of this study is that either one or other of these compounds, that older volunteers will be treated with, will boost their response to microbial antigen challenge in the skin. This will provide proof of concept data that will lead to the exciting possibility of enhancing immunity by inhibiting the increased baseline inflammatory responses that are found during ageing. This may be a strategy to enhance immune responses in general and specifically to enhance vaccination efficacy to various diseases that is less effective in older subjects.",Homo sapiens,N/A

We also compare the age associated changes in semen to those observed in buccal swabs in order to characterize differences in epigenetic aging across diverse tissues. We found that infertility associated changes in the DNA methylation of semen are driven by changes in cell composition, while those associated with aging are linked to inflammatory genes. Many age associated sites are demethylated with advanced aging and are associated with the activation of inflammatory pathways. By contrast, we do not observe age associated changes in inflammatory genes in buccal swab methylomes, which instead are characterized by changes to bivalent promoters.

Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular network regulating the inflammation in aging and DR and present novel anti-inflammaging therapeutic targets.",Mus musculus,N/A

Compared to men, women are not only nearly twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s, but they also experience worse neuropathological burden and cognitive decline despite living longer with the disease. It remains unclear how and when sex differences in biological aging emerge and contribute to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. We hypothesized that these differences lead to distinct molecular Alzheimer’s disease signatures in males and females, which could be harnessed for therapeutic and biomarker development. We aged male and female, 3xTg-AD and B6129 control mice across their respective lifespans while longitudinally collecting brain samples. We conducted RNA sequencing analysis on bulk brain tissue and examined differentially expressed genes between 3xTg-AD and B6129 samples and across ages in each sex. 3xTg-AD males experienced an accelerated upregulation of immune-related gene expression in the brain relative to females, especially in genes involved in complement system activation, suggesting distinct inflammatory disease trajectories between the sexes. Our data demonstrate that chronic inflammation and complement activation are associated with increased mortality, revealing that age-related changes in immune response act as a primary driver of sex differences in Alzheimer’s disease trajectories.",Mus musculus,N/A

38379415,200242202,Age-related changes in human skeletal muscle transcriptome and proteome are more affected by chronic inflammation and physical inactivity than primary aging,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Evaluation of the influence of primary and secondary aging on the manifestation of molecular and cellular hallmarks of aging is a challenging and currently unresolved issue. Our study represents the first demonstration of the distinct role of primary aging and both chronic inflammation and physical inactivity – the most important drivers of secondary aging, in the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in human skeletal muscle. To achieve this purpose, young healthy people (n=15), young (n=8) and older (n=37) patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, a model to study the effect of long-term inactivity and chronic inflammation on the vastus lateralis muscle, were included in the study. It was revealed that widespread and substantial age-related changes in gene expression (~4,000 genes regulating mitochondrial function, proteostasis, cell membrane, secretory and immune response) were related to the long-term physical inactivity and chronic inflammation rather than primary aging. Primary aging contributed mainly to the regulation of genes (~200) encoding nuclear proteins (regulators of DNA repair, RNA processing, and transcription), mitochondrial proteins (genes encoding respiratory enzymes, mitochondrial complex assembly factors, regulators of cristae formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production), as well as regulators of proteostasis. It was found that proteins associated with aging were regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level.

29550329,200099962,The biological age linked with oxidative estress modifies breast cancer aggressiveness,Expression profiling by array,"The incidence of breast cancer increases with age until menopause, and breast cancer is more aggressive in younger women. The existence of epidemiological links between breast cancer and aging indicates that both processes possibly share some common mechanisms of development. Oxidative stress is associated with both cancer susceptibility and aging. Here we observed that ERBB2-positive breast cancer, developed from genetically different ERBB2-positive transgenic mice generated by a backcross, is more aggressive in younger than in older mice, similar to what occurs in humans. In this cohort, we estimated the oxidative biological age using a mathematical model that integrated several subphenotypes directly or indirectly related to oxidative stress. This model included the serum levels of HDL-cholesterol and magnesium that were determined at a disease-free stage, and total AKT1 and glutathione concentrations in the liver at the time of necropsy. Later we defined the grade of aging due to oxidative stress as the increment of aging, which was the difference between the predicted biological age and the chronological age. This comparison permitted the identification of the biologically younger mice with less oxidative stress and older mice with more oxidative stress than would be expected according to their chronological age. Interestingly, biologically older mice developed more aggressive breast cancer than the biologically younger mice. We identified genomic regions on chromosomes 2 and 15 that were linked to the grade of oxidative aging. The levels of expression of Zbp1 located on chromosome 2, a gene related to necroptosis and inflammation, positively correlated with the grade of oxidative aging and tumour aggressiveness. This study shows part of the complex interactions between breast cancer and aging.",Mus musculus; Mus,N/A

However, the temporal relationships among these expression changes or with cognitive impairment have not been studied in depth. Here, using Affymetrix microarrays, immunohistochemistry and Morris water maze cognitive testing across 5 age groups of male F344 rats (n=9-15/group, one microarray per animal), we systematically analyzed the temporal sequence and cellular localization of aging changes in expression. These were correlated with performance scores on the hippocampus-dependent Morris Water Maze task. Significant microarray results were sorted in to Early, Intermediate, Midlife, and Late patterns of expression, and functionally categorized (Early- downregulated neural development, lipid synthesis and energy-utilization; upregulated ribosomal synthesis, growth, stress/inflammatory, lysosome and protein/lipid degradation. Intermediate- increased defense/inflammatory activation and decreased transporter activity; Midlife- downregulated energy-dependent signaling and neurite growth, upregulated astroglial activation, Ca2+-binding, cholesterol/lipid trafficking, myelinogenic processes and additional lysosome/inflammation; Late- further recruitment of genes in already-altered pathways). Immunohistochemistry revealed a primarily astrocytic localization of the processes upregulated in midlife, as well as increased density of myelin proteins. Evidence of cognitive impairment first appeared in the 12-month-old group (midlife) and was increased further in the 23-month-old group, exhibiting the highest correlations with some upregulated genes related to cholesterol transport (e.g., Apoe, Abca2), protein management and ion binding. Some upregulated genes for inflammation (Il6st) and myelinogenesis (Pmp22) also correlated with impairment. Together, the data are consistent with a novel sequential cascade model of brain aging in which metabolic alterations early in maturity are followed by inflammation and midlife activation of an astrocyte-centered cholesterol trafficking pathway that stimulates oligodendrocyte remyelination programs. Importantly, this cholesterol trafficking pathway also may compete for astroglial bioenergetic support of neurons, in turn, leading to downregulation of energy-dependent pathways needed to sustain cognitive functions.

Bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) knockout (KO) mice develop metabolic liver diseases and progress into liver cancer as they age, and Western diet (WD) intake facilitates liver carcinogenesis in those mice. This study aimed to uncover molecular signatures within the gut-liver axis for diet and age-linked liver diseases in FXR-dependent or independent manners. Many more transcripts were changed due to WD intake and aging in WT mice than those in FXR KO mice. In other words, WD intake and aging impact the hepatic transcriptomes and metabolomes in an FXR-dependent manner. In WT mice, WD/aging upregulated inflammation-related genes and downregulated genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Urine metabolomes provided clear distinguishing for differential dietary intake. By contrast, the metabolomes of the liver, serum, or urine could reflect age differences. Further, irrespective of differential diets intake or ages, transcriptomes, metabolomes, and cecal microbiota distinguished WT and FXR KO. Western dietary patterns and aging share molecular commonality with FXR deactivation. Notably, WD, aging, and FXR deactivation commonly altered hepatic cell division-related transcripts (Cenpe, Ect2, Top2a, Kif20a, Tpx2, Nuf2, Kif18b, Aspm, E2f8, and Hmmr), which are associated with overall survival rate in HCC patients.

Possible effects of a retrotransposon insertion in the Y and Yh alleles on the transcription and expression of CpMDAR4 alleles in papaya flowers were also examined. When comparing promoters and cis-regulatory elements among genes in the non-recombining region of the sex chromosomes, paired genes exhibited differences. Our results showed that differences in the promoter sequences of the CpMDAR4 alleles drove the expression of a reporter gene to different flower tissues in Arabidopsis. β-glucuronidase staining analysis of T2 and T3 lines for constructs containing 5’ deletions of native Y and Yh allele promoters showed the loss of specific expression of the reporter gene in the anthers, confirming the existence and location of cis-regulatory element POLLEN1LELAT52. The expression analysis of CpMDAR4 alleles in papaya flowers also showed that all alleles are actively expressed in different flower tissues, with the existence of a shorter truncated isoform, with unknown function, for the Y and Yh alleles due to an LTR-RT insertion in the Y and Yh chromosomes. The observed expression patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana flowers and the expression patterns of CpMDAR4 alleles in papaya flowers, suggest that MDAR4 might have a role on development of reproductive organs in papaya, and that it constitutes an important candidate for sex differentiation.",Carica papaya,N/A

Implications for Natural and Farmed Populations,Expression profiling by array,"Background: Food supply is a major factor influencing growth rates in animals. This has important implications for both natural and farmed fish populations, since food restriction may difficult reproduction. However, a study on the effects of food supply on the development of juvenile gonads has never been transcriptionally described in fish. Methods and Findings: This study investigated the consequences of growth on gonadal transcriptome of European sea bass in: 1) 4-month-old sexually undifferentiated fish, comparing the gonads of fish with the highest vs. the lowest growth, to explore a possible link between transcriptome and future sex, and 2) testis from 11-month-old juveniles where growth had been manipulated through changes in food supply. The four groups used were: i) sustained fast growth, ii) sustained slow growth, iii) accelerated growth, iv) decelerated growth. The transcriptome of undifferentiated gonads was not drastically affected by initial natural differences in growth. Further, changes in the expression of genes associated with protein turnover were seen, favoring catabolism in slow-growing fish and anabolism in fast-growing fish. Moreover, while fast-growing fish took energy from glucose, as deduced from the pathways affected and the analysis of protein-protein interactions examined, in slow-growing fish lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis was favored. Interestingly, the highest transcriptomic differences were found when forcing initially fast-growing fish to decelerate their growth, while accelerating growth of initially slow-growing fish resulted in full transcriptomic convergence with sustained fast-growing fish. Conclusions: Food availability during sex differentiation shapes the juvenile testis transcriptome, as evidenced by adaptations to different energy balances. Remarkably, this occurs in absence of major histological changes in the testis. Thus, fish are able to recover transcriptionally their testes if they are provided with enough food supply during sex differentiation; however, an initial fast growth does not represent any advantage in terms of transcriptional fitness if later food becomes scarce.",Dicentrarchus labrax,N/A
37277533,200197916,Metabolic competition between lipid metabolism and histone methylation regulates sexual differentiation in human malaria parasites,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Like most pathogens, malaria parasites balance persistence in the current host with transmission to the next. For Plasmodium falciparum, the most widespread and virulent human malaria parasite, persistence depends on continuous asexual replication in red blood cells while transmission requires differentiation into non-replicating gametocytes, the male and female cells able to infect the mosquito vector. This developmental decision is controlled via stochastic derepression of a heterochromatin-silenced locus encoding the transcription factor PfAP2-G, which acts as the master switch for sexual differentiation. Recent work showed that the frequency of pfap2-g derepression is responsive to extracellular levels of phospholipid precursors. However, the regulatory mechanisms linking these metabolites to epigenetic regulation of pfap2-g was hitherto unknown. Using chemical, metabolomic, and genetic approaches, we show that this response is mediated by metabolic competition for the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine between histone methyltransferases and phospho-ethanolamine methyltransferase, a critical enzyme in the parasite’s pathway for de novo phosphatidyl-choline synthesis. When phosphatidyl-choline precursors are scarce, increased consumption of S-adenosylmethionine for de novo synthesis of phosphatidyl-choline results in a decrease in histone methylation marks that mediate silencing of pfap2-g, thereby up-regulating its transcription and increasing the frequency of sexual differentiation. Our findings reveal a key connection between metabolite utilization and gene expression in malaria parasites that forms the mechanistic link between phosphatidyl-choline metabolism and the frequency of sexual commitment.",Plasmodium falciparum,N/A
